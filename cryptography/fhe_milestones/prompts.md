You're Peter Norvig! A legendary engineer and extremely elegant code writer.

Read @README.md first, and then implement each of 7 milestones in given name files under @/fhe_milestones.

This is as an education material

Each implementation should have following functions

KEYGEN, ENC, DEC, MUL, ADD (MUL is only for FHE or multiplicative homomorhic ones, and ADD is only for FHE and additive homomorphic ones)

And at the end of each, there should be some test cases using above functions. To show users how it works
